## Instructions

To play memory match you click on a card to flip it over, and then click on another card to flip it over and see it the two cards match. If the two cards match they will stay turned over. Your goal is to match all of the cards.

You are given a star rating as you play. You will begin with three stars and your star rating will slowly decrease everytime your flipped cards do not mach. After 12 failed matches your star rating will decrease to two, and after 16 failed matches your star rating will decrease to one.

You can restart the game at any time.

Your moves and time will be tracked as you play. When you win the game by matching all of the cards, a pop-up will display your game stats and ask you if you would like to play again.
